1
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:06,798
christmas comes but once a year

2
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:11,135
for every girl and boy

3
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:15,475
the laughter and the joy

4
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:19,977
they find in each new toy

5
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:24,482
i'll tell you of a little boy

6
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:28,987
who lives across the way

7
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:33,407
this little fella's christmas

8
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:37,788
is just another day

9
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:11,295
it was just before dawn

10
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:14,006
one miserable morning

11
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:16,051
in black '44

12
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:23,724
when the forward commander
was told to sit tight

13
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:27,728
when he asked that
his men be withdrawn

14
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,692
and the generals gave thanks

15
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,694
as the other ranks

16
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:39,197
held back the enemy tanks

17
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,241
for a while

18
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:43,826
and the anzio bridgehead

19
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,413
was held for the price

20
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:49,667
of a few hundred ordinary lives

21
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:18,319
he's the little boy

22
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:25,326
that santa claus forgot

23
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,661
and goodness knows

24
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:32,916
he didn't want a lot

25
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:38,338
he sent a note to santa

26
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:43,344
for some soldiers and a drum

27
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:46,972
it broke his little heart

28
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:51,643
when he found santa hadn't come

29
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,938
in the street he envies

30
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:59,192
all those lucky boys

31
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,298
so ya thought ya

32
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,300
might like to

33
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,302
go to the show

34
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,601
to feel the warm thrill
of confusion

35
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:44,854
that space cadet glow

36
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:51,360
tell me is something
eluding you sunshine

37
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:55,782
is this not what
you expected to see

38
00:07:55,865 --> 00:08:00,661
if you wanna find out
what's behind these cold eyes

39
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:05,874
you'll just have to
claw your way through this disguise

40
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:35,814
mama loves her baby

41
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,486
and daddy loves you too

42
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:47,908
and the sea may look
warm to you babe

43
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,538
and the sky may look blue

44
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:58,209
ooh ooh ooh

45
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,378

46
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:08,929
ooh ooh ooh

47
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:12,181

00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:21,191
ooh ooh ooh

49
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:25,361
ooh ooh babe

50
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,742
if you should go skating

51
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,828
on the thin ice of modern life

52
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:40,168
dragging behind you

53
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,669
the silent reproach

54
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:46,966
of a million tear-stained eyes

55
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:50,636
don't be surprised

56
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,889
when a crack in the ice

57
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:57,517
appears under your feet

58
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:04,399
you slip out of your depth
and out of your mind

59
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:08,320
with you fear
flowing out behind you

60
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:10,949
as you claw the thin ice

61
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,968
daddy's flown across the ocean

62
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:24,312
leaving just a memory

63
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:33,820
a snapshot in the family album

64
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,830
daddy what else
did you leave for me

65
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,632
daddy what'd ya leave behind for me

66
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:01,473
all in all it was

67
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,600
just a brick in the wall

68
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:14,194
all in all it was all
just bricks in the wall

69
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,968

70
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:52,272

71
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:55,316

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,403

and kind old king george

79
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,933
sent mother a note

80
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:40,728
when he heard that father was gone

81
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:46,150
it was i recall

82
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:49,278
in the form of a scroll

83
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:51,488
gold leaf and all

84
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,453
and i found it one day

85
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,831
in a drawer of old photographs

86
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,833
hidden away

87
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,881
and my eyes still grow damp
to remember

88
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,799
his majesty signed

89
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,636
with his own rubber stamp

90
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,975
it was dark all around

91
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,560
there was frost in the ground

92
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,772
when the tigers broke free

93
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,319
and no one survived

94
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:36,658
from the royal fusiliers company c

95
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,039
they were all left behind

96
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,791
most of them dead

97
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,878
the rest of them dying

98
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,967
and that's how the high command

99
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,805
took my daddy from me

100
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:04,036
did you see the frightened ones

101
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:08,330
did you hear the falling bombs

102
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:13,002
did you ever wonder why
we had to run for shelter

103
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:18,715
when the promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath the clear blue sky

104
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:39,110
did you see the frightened ones

105
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:43,615
did you hear the falling bombs

106
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:48,787
the flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on

107
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,416
good-bye

108
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,963

stand still laddie

127
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,468
when we grew up and went to school

128
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:17,014
there were certain teachers who would
hurt the children anyway they could

129
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,022
by pouring their derision
upon anything we did

130
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:27,401
exposing every weakness

131
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:31,153
however carefully hidden
by the kids

132
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:33,657
what have we here laddie?

133
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,951

144
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:10,109
an acre is the area
of a rectangle

145
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,445
whose length is one furlong

146
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:15,280
and whose width is one chain

147
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:17,616
but in this town it was well known

148
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:21,995
when they got home at night
their fat and psychopathic wives

149
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:25,372
would thrash them
within inches of their lives

150
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:48,646
we don't need no education

151
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,863

01:07:08,336 --> 01:07:12,633
can you show me where it hurts

401
01:07:12,716 --> 01:07:17,595
there is no pain
you are receding

402
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:25,062
a distant ship smoke
on the horizon

403
01:07:28,148 --> 01:07:32,567
you are only coming through in waves

404
01:07:35,154 --> 01:07:37,114
your lips move

405
01:07:37,156 --> 01:07:40,034
but i can't hear what you're saying

406
01:07:42,828 --> 01:07:45,705
when i was a child

407
01:07:45,789 --> 01:07:48,124
i had a fever

408
01:07:50,335 --> 01:07:56,175
my hands felt just like two balloons

409
01:07:58,218 --> 01:08:02,806
now i've got that feeling once again

410
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:07,018
i can't explain
you would not understand

411
01:08:07,102 --> 01:08:10,647
this is not how i am

412
01:08:13,441 --> 01:08:18,070
i

413
01:08:18,154 --> 01:08:21,575
have become comfortably numb

414
01:08:55,065 --> 01:09:00,030
i

415
01:09:00,113 --> 01:09:02,906
have become comfortably numb

416
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,162
okay

417
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,498
just a little pinprick

418
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:17,003
there'll be no more ah

419
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:19,839
but you may feel a little sick

420
01:09:21,091 --> 01:09:24,344
can you stand up

421
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,846
i do believe it's working

422
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,140
- good
- he's coming around

423
01:09:28,224 --> 01:09:33,144
- that'll keep you going through the show
- there you see?

424
01:09:33,228 --> 01:09:36,814
- come on it's time to go
- how do you feel?

425
01:09:36,898 --> 01:09:41,986
there is no pain
you are receding

426
01:09:44,864 --> 01:09:49,160
a distant ship smoke
on the horizon

427
01:09:52,205 --> 01:09:56,500
you are only coming through in waves

428
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,213
your lips move

429
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:04,258
but i can't hear what you're saying

430
01:10:06,886 --> 01:10:09,847
when i was a child

431
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:12,641
i caught a fleeting glimpse

432
01:10:15,184 --> 01:10:19,524
out of the corner of my eye

433
01:10:22,568 --> 01:10:26,572
i turned to look but it was gone

434
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:31,367
i cannot put my finger on it now

435
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:35,581
the child is grown
the dream is gone

436
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:42,129
i

437
01:10:42,212 --> 01:10:46,800
have become comfortably numb

438
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,014
so ya thought ya

439
01:14:27,098 --> 01:14:30,143
might like to go to the show

440
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:37,358
to feel the warm thrill
of confusion

441
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,319
that space cadet glow

442
01:14:43,531 --> 01:14:47,870
i got some bad news for you sunshine

443
01:14:47,953 --> 01:14:51,998
pink isn't well
he's uh back at the hotel

444
01:14:52,081 --> 01:14:55,125
and they sent us along
as a surrogate band

445
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:59,589
now tonight we 're gonna find out
where you fans really stand

446
01:15:02,842 --> 01:15:05,552
are there any queers
in the audience tonight

447
01:15:07,554 --> 01:15:11,850
- get 'em up against the wall
- against the wall

448
01:15:11,933 --> 01:15:15,104
there's one in the spotlight
he don't look right

449
01:15:17,354 --> 01:15:21,861
- have him up against the wall
- against the wall

450
01:15:21,943 --> 01:15:26,323
and that one looks jewish
and that one's a coon

451
01:15:26,406 --> 01:15:29,951
who let all this riff raff
into the room

452
01:15:30,035 --> 01:15:32,203
there's one smoking a joint

453
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:36,416
and that one's got spots

454
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,628
if i had my way
i'd have all of you shot

455
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:19,800
run run run run

456
01:17:27,692 --> 01:17:31,736
you better make your face up
in your favourite disguise

457
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:36,283
with your button-down lips
and your roller-blind eyes

458
01:17:36,366 --> 01:17:40,412
with your empty smile
and your hungry heart

459
01:17:40,496 --> 01:17:44,332
feel the bile rising
from your guilty past

460
01:17:44,415 --> 01:17:48,545
with your nerves in tatters
as the cockleshell shatters

461
01:17:48,587 --> 01:17:52,383
and the hammers batter down your door

462
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:57,179
you better run run run run

463
01:17:57,262 --> 01:18:05,262
run run run run

464
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:12,985
you better run all day
and run all night

465
01:18:13,069 --> 01:18:17,031
keep your dirty feelings deep inside

466
01:18:17,073 --> 01:18:21,117
and if you're taking
your girlfriend out tonight

467
01:18:21,202 --> 01:18:25,540
you'd better park the car
well out of sight

468
01:18:25,623 --> 01:18:29,460
'cause if they catch you in
the back seat trying to pick her locks

469
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:33,547
they're gonna send you back to mother
in a cardboard box

470
01:18:33,631 --> 01:18:35,550
you better run

471
01:19:07,538 --> 01:19:09,875
you cannot reach me now

472
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:17,798
no matter how you try

473
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:22,012
good-bye cruel world

474
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:24,598

476
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:32,939
waiting

477
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:36,108
- to cut out the dead wood
- waiting

478
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:39,487
- to weed out the weaklings
- waiting

479
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:43,241
to smash in their windows
and kick in their doors

480
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:47,745
waiting - for the final
solution to strengthen the strain

481
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:51,499
- waiting
- to follow the worms

482
01:19:54,793 --> 01:19:58,088
- would you like to see
- would you like to see

483
01:19:58,172 --> 01:20:01,509

484
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,094
my friend

485
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:12,812

is follow the worms

486
01:20:56,104 --> 01:21:04,104
hammer hammer

487
01:21:18,626 --> 01:21:23,338
hammer hammer hammer

488
01:21:23,422 --> 01:21:26,299

take off this uniform
and leave the show

492
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:42,600
but i'm waiting in this cell

493
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:45,895
because i have to know

494
01:23:47,437 --> 01:23:50,900

495
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:56,404
have i been guilty all this time

496
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,040
good morning worm your honour

497
01:24:50,124 --> 01:24:52,459
the crown will plainly show

498
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:56,338
the prisoner who now stands before you

499
01:24:56,421 --> 01:25:01,301
was caught red-handed showing feelings

500
01:25:01,343 --> 01:25:06,890
showing feelings
of an almost human nature

501
01:25:06,973 --> 01:25:10,726
this will not do

502
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:13,021
call the schoolmaster

503
01:25:13,105 --> 01:25:16,065

504
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:18,609
in the end your honour

505
01:25:18,651 --> 01:25:21,112
if they'd let me have my way

506
01:25:21,195 --> 01:25:25,450
i could have flayed him into shape

507
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:28,410
but my hands were tied

508
01:25:28,494 --> 01:25:30,873
the bleeding hearts and artists

509
01:25:30,955 --> 01:25:34,332

510
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:37,545

i hope they throw away the key

519
01:26:23,089 --> 01:26:27,385

more often than you did

520
01:26:27,427 --> 01:26:31,097
but no

over the rainbow i'm crazy

532
01:27:19,102 --> 01:27:22,481
bars in the window

533
01:27:25,316 --> 01:27:30,405
there must have been a door there
in the wall

534
01:27:30,488 --> 01:27:35,368
- when i came in
- crazy

535
01:27:35,452 --> 01:27:41,541
over the rainbow he is crazy

536
01:27:45,463 --> 01:27:51,634
the evidence before the court
is incontrovertible

537
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:55,805
there's no need
for the jury to retire

538
01:27:58,057 --> 01:28:00,685
in all my years of judging

539
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,979
i have never heard before

540
01:28:04,062 --> 01:28:06,649
of someone more deserving

541
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:10,695
the full penalty of law

542
01:28:10,777 --> 01:28:13,198
the way you made them suffer

543
01:28:13,281 --> 01:28:16,992
your exquisite wife and mother

544
01:28:17,034 --> 01:28:20,453
fills me with the urge to defecate

545
01:28:23,248 --> 01:28:28,962
since my friend
you have revealed your deepest fear

546
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:32,840
i sentence you to be exposed

547
01:28:32,882 --> 01:28:35,928
before your peers

548
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:44,010
tear down the wall

549
01:31:45,029 --> 01:31:47,532
all alone

550
01:31:47,573 --> 01:31:49,533
or in two's

551
01:31:51,286 --> 01:31:55,330
the ones who really love you

552
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:02,254
walk up and down

553
01:32:02,338 --> 01:32:04,256
outside the wall

554
01:32:10,052 --> 01:32:14,016
some hand in hand

555
01:32:15,934 --> 01:32:20,230
some gathered together in bands

556
01:32:22,774 --> 01:32:28,071
the bleeding hearts
and the artists

557
01:32:28,113 --> 01:32:30,072
make their stand

558
01:32:33,868 --> 01:32:39,248
and when they've given you their all

559
01:32:39,332 --> 01:32:42,169
some stagger and fall

560
01:32:42,252 --> 01:32:45,671
after all it's not easy

561
01:32:47,924 --> 01:32:50,426
banging your heart

562
01:32:50,509 --> 01:32:55,055
against some mad bugger's wall

563
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:18,470
when they've given you their all

564
01:34:18,512 --> 01:34:21,140
some stagger and fall

565
01:34:21,223 --> 01:34:24,601
after all it's not easy
