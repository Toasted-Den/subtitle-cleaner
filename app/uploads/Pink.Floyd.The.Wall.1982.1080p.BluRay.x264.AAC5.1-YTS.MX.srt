1
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:06,798
Christmas comes but once a year.

2
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:11,135
For every girl and boy.

3
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:15,475
The laughter and the joy.

4
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:19,977
They find in each new toy

5
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:24,482
I'll tell you of a little boy.

6
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:28,987
Who lives across the way.

7
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:33,407
This little fella's Christmas.

8
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:37,788
Is just another day.

9
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:11,295
It was just before dawn.

10
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:14,006
One miserable morning.

11
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:16,051
In black '44.

12
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:23,724
When the forward commander
was told to sit tight.

13
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:27,728
When he asked that
his men be withdrawn.

14
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,692
And the generals gave thanks.

15
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,694
As the other ranks.

16
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:39,197
Held back the enemy tanks.

17
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,241
For a while.

18
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:43,826
And the Anzio bridgehead.

19
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,413
Was held for the price.

20
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:49,667
Of a few hundred ordinary lives.

21
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:18,319
He's the little boy.

22
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:25,326
That Santa Claus forgot.

23
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,661
And Goodness knows.

24
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:32,916
He didn't want a lot.

25
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:38,338
He sent a note to Santa.

26
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:43,344
For some soldiers and a drum.

27
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:46,972
It broke his little heart.

28
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:51,643
When he found Santa hadn't come.

29
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,938
In the street he envies.

30
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:59,192
All those lucky boys.

31
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,298
So ya thought ya.

32
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,300
Might like to.

33
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,302
Go to the show.

34
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,601
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion.

35
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:44,854
That space cadet glow.

36
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:51,360
Tell me, is something
eluding you, sunshine.

37
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:55,782
Is this not what
you expected to see.

38
00:07:55,865 --> 00:08:00,661
If you wanna find out
what's behind these cold eyes.

39
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:05,874
You'll just have to
claw your way through this disguise.

40
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:35,814
Mama loves her baby.

41
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,486
And Daddy loves you too.

42
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:47,908
And the sea may look
warm to you, babe.

43
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,538
And the sky may look blue.

44
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:58,209
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

45
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,378
Ooh, babe.

46
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:08,929
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

47
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:12,181
Baby blue.

48
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:21,191
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

49
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:25,361
Ooh, ooh, babe.

50
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,742
If you should go skating.

51
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,828
On the thin ice of modern life.

52
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:40,168
Dragging behind you.

53
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,669
The silent reproach.

54
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:46,966
Of a million tear-stained eyes.

55
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:50,636
Don't be surprised.

56
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,889
When a crack in the ice.

57
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:57,517
Appears under your feet.

58
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:04,399
You slip out of your depth
and out of your mind.

59
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:08,320
With you fear
flowing out behind you.

60
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:10,949
As you claw the thin ice.

61
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,968
Daddy's flown across the ocean.

62
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:24,312
Leaving just a memory.

63
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:33,820
A snapshot in the family album.

64
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,830
Daddy, what else
did you leave for me.

65
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,632
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me.

66
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:01,473
All in all it was.

67
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,600
Just a brick in the wall.

68
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:14,194
All in all it was all
just bricks in the wall.

69
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,968
Easy. Be careful.

70
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:52,272
- What?
- Will you put me on there?

71
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:55,316
- Well, where's your mother, then?
- She's gone to the shops.

72
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,403
Yes, all right.

73
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:02,073
How's that then? Enjoying it?

74
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:09,455
Lovely, lovely.

75
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:23,343
Now off you go.
Go on.

76
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:27,449
Now what have I told you about this?
What have I told you?

77
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:31,311
Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.
Go on. Sling your hook.

78
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,014
And kind old King George.

79
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,933
Sent Mother a note.

80
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:40,728
When he heard that Father was gone.

81
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:46,150
It was, I recall.

82
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:49,278
In the form of a scroll.

83
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:51,488
Gold leaf and all.

84
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,453
And I found it one day.

85
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,831
In a drawer of old photographs.

86
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,833
Hidden away.

87
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,881
And my eyes still grow damp
to remember.

88
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,799
His Majesty signed.

89
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,636
With his own rubber stamp.

90
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,975
It was dark all around.

91
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,560
There was frost in the ground.

92
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,772
When the tigers broke free.

93
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,319
And no one survived.

94
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:36,658
From the Royal Fusiliers Company C.

95
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,039
They were all left behind.

96
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,791
Most of them dead.

97
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,878
The rest of them dying.

98
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,967
And that's how the high command.

99
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,805
Took my daddy from me.

100
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:04,036
Did you see the frightened ones.

101
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:08,330
Did you hear the falling bombs.

102
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:13,002
Did you ever wonder why
we had to run for shelter.

103
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:18,715
When the promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath the clear blue sky.

104
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:39,110
Did you see the frightened ones.

105
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:43,615
Did you hear the falling bombs.

106
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:48,787
The flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on.

107
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,416
Good-bye.

108
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,963
Blue sky.

109
00:20:57,046 --> 00:21:00,506
Good-bye, blue sky.

110
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,510
Good-bye.

111
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:06,929
Good-bye.

112
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:16,647
Wait for me, Pinky,
you rotten bleeder.

113
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,651
- They're my bullets, ain't they?
- I don't know.

114
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:23,112
Come on, Tubs.
It's great down in the tunnel.

115
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:25,531
Don't you think
it'd be dangerous, Pinky?

116
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:27,409
No. Don't be daft.

117
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:41,630
- You all right, Tubs?
- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.

118
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,347
- Come on.
- Na. It's too dangerous.

119
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:54,350
- We'll wait for the train.
- Give me the torch.

120
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:06,989
Pinky! Here comes the train!

121
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:09,575
Get off the line,
you bloody idiot! Here it comes!

122
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:15,455
Pinky, get off the line!
Here it comes!

123
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:17,706
Pinky, get off the line!

124
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:37,183
You!

125
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:43,608
You! Yes, you!

126
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:45,525
Stand still, laddie!

127
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,468
When we grew up and went to school.

128
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:17,014
There were certain teachers who would
hurt the children anyway they could.

129
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,022
By pouring their derision
upon anything we did.

130
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:27,401
Exposing every weakness.

131
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:31,153
However carefully hidden
by the kids.

132
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:33,657
What have we here, laddie?

133
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,951
Mysterious scribblings?
A secret code?

134
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,537
No. Poems, no less.

135
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,749
Poems, everybody!

136
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,001
The lad here reckons himself
a poet.

137
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:49,255
"Money, get back.
I'm all right, Jack.

138
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:52,508
Keep your hands off my stack.

139
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:55,844
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream.

140
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:59,098
Think I'll buy me
a football team."

141
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,766
Absolute rubbish, laddie!

142
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:05,103
Get on with your work.

143
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:06,813
Repeat after me:

144
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:10,109
An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

145
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,445
whose length is one furlong...

146
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:15,280
and whose width is one chain.

147
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:17,616
But in this town it was well known.

148
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:21,995
When they got home at night
their fat and psychopathic wives.

149
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:25,372
Would thrash them
within inches of their lives.

150
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:48,646
We don't need no education.

151
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,863
We don't need no thought control.

152
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:07,122
No dark sarcasm in the classroom.

153
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:15,506
Teacher, leave them kids alone.

154
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:26,599
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone.

155
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:36,026
All in all it's just
another brick in the wall.

156
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,780
Wrong! Do it again!

157
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:45,535
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall.

158
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,376
We don't need no education.

159
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,378
If you don't eat your meat,
you can't have any pudding!

160
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,717
We don't need no thought control.

161
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,551
How can you have any pudding
if you don't eat your meat?

162
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:05,887
No dark sarcasm in the classroom.

163
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,558
You! Yes, you, laddie!

164
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,894
Poems, everybody.
The lad here reckons himself a poet.

165
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:16,232
Teachers, leave them kids alone.

166
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:25,950
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone.

167
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:36,125
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall.

168
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,800
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall.

169
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:35,226
We don't need no education.

170
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:54,578
No dark sarcasm in the classroom.

171
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:03,377
Again. An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

172
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:05,713
whose length is one furlong...

173
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:08,550
and whose width is one chain.

174
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:04,230
Mother, do you think
they'll drop the bomb.

175
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:20,537
Mother, do you think
they'll like the song.

176
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:38,763
Mother, do you think
they'll try to break my balls.

177
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:51,693
Mother, should I build the wall.

178
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:22,307
Mother, should I run for president.

179
00:30:35,735 --> 00:30:38,988
Mother, should I trust the government.

180
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:57,131
Mother, will they put me
in the firing line.

181
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:10,770
Mother, am I really dying.

182
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:20,696
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry.

183
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,747
Mama's gonna make all of
your nightmares come true.

184
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:36,045
Mama's gonna put
all of her fears into you.

185
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:41,299
Mama's gonna keep you
right here under her wing.

186
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:46,596
She won't let you fly
but she might let you sing.

187
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:52,602
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm.

188
00:31:56,273 --> 00:31:59,650
Ooooh, babe.

189
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:05,615
Ooooh, babe.

Ooh, babe, of course
Mama's gonna help build the wall.

191
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:54,245
Hello. Hello.
Is there anybody in there?

192
00:32:58,291 --> 00:32:59,959
Do you remember me?

193
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,295
I'm the one
from the Registry Office.

194
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:16,309
Mother, do you think
she's good enough.

195
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:24,317
For me.

196
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:33,159
And, Mother
do you think she's dangerous.

197
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:41,500
To me.

198
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:50,425
Mother, will she tear
your little boy apart.

199
00:33:56,806 --> 00:34:01,187
Ooooh, Ma.

200
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:03,689
Mother, will she break my heart.

201
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,031
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry.

202
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:24,250
Mama's gonna check out
all your girlfriends for you.

203
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:29,590
Mama won't let anyone
dirty get through.

204
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:34,887
Mama's gonna wait up
until you get in.

205
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:40,099
Mama will always find out
where you've been.

206
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:45,688
Mama's gonna keep baby
healthy and clean.

207
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:53,570
Oooh, babe.

208
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:58,950
Oooh, babe.

209
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:06,416
Ooh, babe
You'll always be baby to me.

210
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,808
Mother, did it need to be so high.

211
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:49,250
- Hello?
- Yes, a collect call...

212
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,545
for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.

213
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:54,630
Will you accept the charge
from the United States?

214
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:02,531
I wonder why he hung up. Is there
supposed to be someone else there...

215
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:04,598
besides your wife, sir,
to answer?

216
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:10,729
- Hello?

To fill.

221
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:14,307
The empty spaces.

222
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,811
Where waves.

223
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,479
Of hunger.

224
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,276
Roar.

Of faces.

228
00:38:32,284 --> 00:38:36,289
In search of more.

229
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:41,334
And more applause.

230
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:04,316

Leave the lights on Drop bombs.

00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,917
Do tours of the East
Contract diseases

236
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:25,337
Bury bones Break up homes.

237
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:27,671
Send flowers by phone.

00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:30,008
Take to drink Go to shrinks.

239
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,302
Give up meat Rarely sleep.

240
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:34,511
Keep people as pets.

241
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,889
Train dogs Race rats.

00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:45,981
But never relax at all.

245
00:39:47,274 --> 00:39:50,444
With our backs to the wall.

246
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:28,313
I am just a new boy.

247
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:32,402
A stranger in this town.

248
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:38,074
Where are all the good times.

249
00:40:40,076 --> 00:40:44,080
Who's gonna show this stranger around.

250
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:59,220
Ooooh

251
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:01,222
I need a dirty woman.

252
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:09,354
Ooooh

253
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,357

00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:33,461

00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:59,904
Ooooh

261
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:01,906
I need a dirty girl.

262
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:55,542
Ooooh

I need a dirty girl.

266
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,252
Oh, my God.

267
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,881
What a fabulous room.

268
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:50,637
Are all these your guitars?

269
00:44:05,151 --> 00:44:07,111
God.

270
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:10,072
This place is bigger
than our whole apartment.

271
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:25,880
You like the tube, huh?

272
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:31,885
Can I get a drink of water?

273
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:38,684
Can I get you a drink of water?

274
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:58,036
Oh, wow, look at this tub!

275
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,539
Wanna take a bath?

276
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:14,676
What are you watching?

277
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:23,520
Hello? Hello?

278
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,486
You feeling okay?

279
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,281
Day after day.

280
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:39,077
Love turns grey.

281
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,746
Like the skin of a dying man.

282
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:49,128
And night after night.

283
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:52,839
We pretend it's all right.

284
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:56,260
But I have grown older.

285
00:45:56,344 --> 00:45:59,596
And you have grown colder.

286
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:05,143
And nothing is very much fun any more.

287
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:11,816
And I can feel.

288
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:16,946
One of my turns coming on.

289
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:22,827
I

290
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,164
Feel.

291
00:46:26,248 --> 00:46:29,584
Cold as a razor blade.

292
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:32,920
Tight as a tourniquet.

293
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:36,967
Dry as a funeral drum.

294
00:46:41,388 --> 00:46:43,305
Run to the bedroom.

295
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:48,478
In the suitcase on the left
you'll find my favourite axe.

296
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:56,609
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase.

297
00:46:56,693 --> 00:46:59,822
One of my bad days.

298
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:05,660
Would you like to watch TV.

299
00:47:05,743 --> 00:47:11,292
Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway.

300
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:13,961
Would you like something to eat.

301
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:16,880
Would you like to learn to fly.

302
00:47:18,423 --> 00:47:21,677
Would ya
Would you like to see me try.

303
00:47:57,586 --> 00:48:00,256
Would you like to call the cops.

304
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,926
- Do you think it's time I stopped.
- Next time, fuckers!

305
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:09,973
Why are you running away.

306
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:11,659
Oooh, babe.

307
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,331
Don't leave me now.

308
00:49:26,424 --> 00:49:28,801
How could you go.

309
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,396
When you know how I need you.

310
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:56,161
To beat to a pulp
on a Saturday night.

311
00:49:56,244 --> 00:50:01,541
Oh, babe.

312
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,377
Don't leave me now.

313
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:21,311
How can you treat me this way.

314
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:26,900
Running away.

315
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:37,993
Ooh, babe.

316
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:43,832
Why are you running away.

317
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:51,005
Oooh, babe.

318
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:02,726
Oooh, babe.

319
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:39,804
I don't need no arms around me.

320
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:48,395
And I don't need
no drugs to calm me.

321
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:58,447
I have seen the writing on the wall.

322
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:06,580
Don't think I need anything at all.

323
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:12,586
No.

324
00:52:12,627 --> 00:52:15,297
Don't think I need anything at all.

325
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:27,893
All and all it was all
just bricks in the wall.

326
00:52:31,854 --> 00:52:36,859
All and all you were all
just bricks in the wall.

327
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:11,476
Good-bye, cruel world

328
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,355
I'm leaving you today.

329
00:53:16,189 --> 00:53:20,735
Good-bye, good-bye.

330
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:22,737
Good-bye.

331
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:35,166
Good-bye, all you people.

332
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,254
There's nothing you can say.

333
00:53:39,337 --> 00:53:44,426
To make me change my mind.

334
00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:46,761
Good-bye.

335
00:54:13,704 --> 00:54:16,081
Is there anybody out there.

336
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:28,218
Is there anybody out there.

337
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,562
Is there anybody out there.

338
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,371
Is there anybody out there.

339
00:57:57,172 --> 00:58:01,802
I've got a little black book
with my poems in.

340
00:58:01,886 --> 00:58:06,431
Got a bag with a toothbrush
and a comb in.

341
00:58:06,514 --> 00:58:12,270
When I'm a good dog
they sometimes throw me a bone in.

342
00:58:14,982 --> 00:58:19,486
I got elastic bands
keeping my shoes on.

343
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:23,990
Got those swollen-hand blues

344
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:30,456
I've got 13 channels of shit
on the TV to choose from.

345
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,835
I've got electric light.

346
00:58:39,464 --> 00:58:42,133
And I've got second sight

347
00:58:42,217 --> 00:58:48,056
I've got amazing powers
of observation.

348
00:58:53,143 --> 00:58:55,687
And that is how I know.

349
00:58:56,855 --> 00:59:00,068
When I try to get through.

350
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:03,403
On the telephone to you.

351
00:59:08,324 --> 00:59:11,328
There'll be nobody home.

352
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:23,172
I got the obligatory Hendrix perm.

353
00:59:23,257 --> 00:59:28,303
And the inevitable pinhole burns.

354
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:33,934
All down the front
of my favourite satin shirt.

355
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:41,358
I've got nicotine stains
on my fingers

356
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,113
I've got a silver spoon on a chain.

357
00:59:46,196 --> 00:59:51,701
Got a grand piano
to prop up my mortal remains.

358
00:59:54,662 --> 01:00:00,333
I got wild staring eyes.

359
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:03,296
And I got a strong urge to fly.

360
01:00:06,548 --> 01:00:10,052
But I got nowhere to fly to.

361
01:00:18,227 --> 01:00:23,191
Oooh, babe.

362
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:26,735
When I pick up the phone.

363
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:32,949
There's still nobody home.

364
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:44,669
I've got a pair of Gohills boots.

365
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:48,965
And I got fading roots.

366
01:03:16,068 --> 01:03:22,241
Does anybody here
remember Vera Lynn.

367
01:03:26,911 --> 01:03:29,622
Remember how she said.

368
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:33,292
That we would meet again.

369
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:36,837
Some sunny day.

370
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:06,617
Vera.

371
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:11,497
What has become of you.

372
01:04:16,376 --> 01:04:20,047
Does anybody else in here.

373
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:22,382
Feel the way I do.

374
01:04:43,694 --> 01:04:47,824
Bring the boys back home.

375
01:04:52,662 --> 01:04:57,125
Bring the boys back home.

376
01:05:01,337 --> 01:05:04,465
Don't leave the children.

377
01:05:04,507 --> 01:05:09,053
On their own, no, no.

378
01:05:13,307 --> 01:05:18,019
Bring the boys back home.

379
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:27,029
Bring the boys back home.

380
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:34,787
Don't leave the children.

381
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:39,749
On their own, no, no.

382
01:05:43,546 --> 01:05:48,258
Bring the boys back home.

383
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:54,013
Bad! Do it again!

384
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:05,441
You feeling okay?

385
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:17,203
Is there anybody out there.

386
01:06:17,245 --> 01:06:19,454
Fuck me.

387
01:06:19,538 --> 01:06:22,750
He's gone completely around
the bleeding' twist.

388
01:06:22,834 --> 01:06:25,711
You vicious bastard,
you never did like me, did you?

389
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,382
Hello.

390
01:06:29,424 --> 01:06:31,925
Is there anybody in there.

391
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:37,973
Just nod if you can hear me.

392
01:06:38,056 --> 01:06:40,309
Is there anyone at home.

393
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:45,481
Come on, now

394
01:06:45,565 --> 01:06:49,775
I hear you're feeling down.

395
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:52,653
Well, I can ease your pain.

396
01:06:52,737 --> 01:06:57,242
- And get you on your feet again.
- The boy's an asthmatic.

397
01:06:57,326 --> 01:07:00,287
- Asthmatic!?
- Relax

398
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:04,874
- I'll need some information first.
- He's an artist!

399
01:07:04,957 --> 01:07:08,253
Just the basic facts.

400
01:07:08,336 --> 01:07:12,633
Can you show me where it hurts.

401
01:07:12,716 --> 01:07:17,595
There is no pain
you are receding.

402
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:25,062
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon.

403
01:07:28,148 --> 01:07:32,567
You are only coming through in waves.

404
01:07:35,154 --> 01:07:37,114
Your lips move.

405
01:07:37,156 --> 01:07:40,034
But I can't hear what you're saying.

406
01:07:42,828 --> 01:07:45,705
When I was a child

407
01:07:45,789 --> 01:07:48,124
I had a fever.

408
01:07:50,335 --> 01:07:56,175
My hands felt just like two balloons.

409
01:07:58,218 --> 01:08:02,806
Now I've got that feeling once again

410
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:07,018
I can't explain
you would not understand.

411
01:08:07,102 --> 01:08:10,647
This is not how I am.

412
01:08:13,441 --> 01:08:18,070
I

413
01:08:18,154 --> 01:08:21,575
Have become comfortably numb.

414
01:08:55,065 --> 01:09:00,030
I

415
01:09:00,113 --> 01:09:02,906
Have become comfortably numb.

416
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,162
Okay.

417
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,498
Just a little pinprick.

418
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:17,003
There'll be no more Ah.

419
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:19,839
But you may feel a little sick.

420
01:09:21,091 --> 01:09:24,344
Can you stand up

421
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,846
I do believe it's working.

422
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,140
- Good.
- He's coming around.

423
01:09:28,224 --> 01:09:33,144
- That'll keep you going through the show.
- There, you see?

424
01:09:33,228 --> 01:09:36,814
- Come on, it's time to go.
- How do you feel?

425
01:09:36,898 --> 01:09:41,986
There is no pain
you are receding.

426
01:09:44,864 --> 01:09:49,160
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon.

427
01:09:52,205 --> 01:09:56,500
You are only coming through in waves.

428
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,213
Your lips move.

429
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:04,258
But I can't hear what you're saying.

430
01:10:06,886 --> 01:10:09,847
When I was a child

431
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:12,641
I caught a fleeting glimpse.

432
01:10:15,184 --> 01:10:19,524
Out of the corner of my eye.

433
01:10:22,568 --> 01:10:26,572
I turned to look but it was gone

434
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:31,367
I cannot put my finger on it now.

435
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:35,581
The child is grown
The dream is gone.

436
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:42,129
I

437
01:10:42,212 --> 01:10:46,800
Have become comfortably numb.

438
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,014
So ya thought ya.

439
01:14:27,098 --> 01:14:30,143
Might like to go to the show.

440
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:37,358
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion.

441
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,319
That space cadet glow.

442
01:14:43,531 --> 01:14:47,870
I got some bad news for you, sunshine.

443
01:14:47,953 --> 01:14:51,998
Pink isn't well
He's, uh, back at the hotel.

444
01:14:52,081 --> 01:14:55,125
And they sent us along
as a surrogate band.

445
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:59,589
Now tonight, we 're gonna find out
where you fans really stand.

446
01:15:02,842 --> 01:15:05,552
Are there any queers
in the audience tonight.

447
01:15:07,554 --> 01:15:11,850
- Get 'em up against the wall.
- Against the wall.

448
01:15:11,933 --> 01:15:15,104
There's one in the spotlight
he don't look right.

449
01:15:17,354 --> 01:15:21,861
- Have him up against the wall.
- Against the wall.

450
01:15:21,943 --> 01:15:26,323
And that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon.

451
01:15:26,406 --> 01:15:29,951
Who let all this riff raff
into the room.

452
01:15:30,035 --> 01:15:32,203
There's one smoking a joint.

453
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:36,416
And that one's got spots.

454
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,628
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot.

455
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:19,800
Run, run, run, run.

456
01:17:27,692 --> 01:17:31,736
You better make your face up
in your favourite disguise.

457
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:36,283
With your button-down lips
and your roller-blind eyes.

458
01:17:36,366 --> 01:17:40,412
With your empty smile
and your hungry heart.

459
01:17:40,496 --> 01:17:44,332
Feel the bile rising
from your guilty past.

460
01:17:44,415 --> 01:17:48,545
With your nerves in tatters
as the cockleshell shatters.

461
01:17:48,587 --> 01:17:52,383
And the hammers batter down your door.

462
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:57,179
You better run run, run, run.

463
01:17:57,262 --> 01:18:05,262
Run, run, run, run.

464
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:12,985
You better run all day
and run all night.

465
01:18:13,069 --> 01:18:17,031
Keep your dirty feelings deep inside.

466
01:18:17,073 --> 01:18:21,117
And if you're taking
your girlfriend out tonight.

467
01:18:21,202 --> 01:18:25,540
You'd better park the car
well out of sight.

468
01:18:25,623 --> 01:18:29,460
'Cause if they catch you in
the back seat trying to pick her locks.

469
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:33,547
They're gonna send you back to Mother
in a cardboard box.

470
01:18:33,631 --> 01:18:35,550
You better run.

471
01:19:07,538 --> 01:19:09,875
You cannot reach me now.

472
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:17,798
No matter how you try.

473
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:22,012
Good-bye, cruel world.

474
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:24,598
It's over.

475
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:26,558
Walk on by.

476
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:32,939
Waiting.

477
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:36,108
- To cut out the dead wood.
- Waiting.

478
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:39,487
- To weed out the weaklings.
- Waiting.

479
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:43,241
To smash in their windows
and kick in their doors.

480
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:47,745
Waiting - For the final
solution to strengthen the strain.

481
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:51,499
- Waiting.
- To follow the worms.

482
01:19:54,793 --> 01:19:58,088
- Would you like to see.
- Would you like to see.

483
01:19:58,172 --> 01:20:01,509
Britannia rule again.

484
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,094
My friend.

485
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:12,812
All you need to do
is follow the worms.

486
01:20:56,104 --> 01:21:04,104
Hammer! Hammer!

487
01:21:18,626 --> 01:21:23,338
Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!

488
01:21:23,422 --> 01:21:26,299
Stop!

489
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,701
Stop.

490
01:23:24,998 --> 01:23:26,917
I wanna go home.

491
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,843
Take off this uniform
and leave the show.

492
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:42,600
But I'm waiting in this cell.

493
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:45,895
Because I have to know.

494
01:23:47,437 --> 01:23:50,900
Have I been.

495
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:56,404
Have I been guilty all this time.

496
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,040
Good morning, Worm, Your Honour.

497
01:24:50,124 --> 01:24:52,459
The crown will plainly show.

498
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:56,338
The prisoner who now stands before you.

499
01:24:56,421 --> 01:25:01,301
Was caught red-handed showing feelings.

500
01:25:01,343 --> 01:25:06,890
Showing feelings
of an almost human nature.

501
01:25:06,973 --> 01:25:10,726
This will not do.

502
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:13,021
Call the schoolmaster

503
01:25:13,105 --> 01:25:16,065
I always said he'd come to no good.

504
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:18,609
In the end, Your Honour.

505
01:25:18,651 --> 01:25:21,112
If they'd let me have my way

506
01:25:21,195 --> 01:25:25,450
I could have flayed him into shape.

507
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:28,410
But my hands were tied.

508
01:25:28,494 --> 01:25:30,873
The bleeding hearts and artists.

509
01:25:30,955 --> 01:25:34,332
Let him get away with murder.

510
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:37,545
Let me hammer him today.

511
01:25:39,964 --> 01:25:43,342
Crazy.

512
01:25:43,383 --> 01:25:49,430
Toys in the attic I am crazy.

513
01:25:49,514 --> 01:25:52,685
Truly gone fishing.

514
01:25:56,522 --> 01:26:02,444
They must have taken my marbles away.

515
01:26:02,527 --> 01:26:05,864
Crazy.

516
01:26:05,947 --> 01:26:12,204
Toys in the attic He is crazy.

517
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:19,711
You little shit You're in it now

518
01:26:19,795 --> 01:26:23,048
I hope they throw away the key.

519
01:26:23,089 --> 01:26:27,385
You should've talked to me
more often than you did.

520
01:26:27,427 --> 01:26:31,097
But no
You had to go your own way.

521
01:26:31,181 --> 01:26:34,600
Have you broken
any homes up lately.

522
01:26:34,684 --> 01:26:37,938
Just five minutes, Worm, Your Honour.

523
01:26:38,021 --> 01:26:40,941
Him and me alone.

524
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:48,657
Babe.

525
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,950
Come to Mother, baby.

526
01:26:51,033 --> 01:26:54,787
Let me hold you in my arms.

527
01:26:54,871 --> 01:27:00,376
My Lord, I never wanted him
to get in any trouble.

528
01:27:00,417 --> 01:27:03,671
Why did he ever have to leave me.

529
01:27:03,754 --> 01:27:07,757
Worm, Your Honour
let me take him home.

530
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:12,555
Crazy.

531
01:27:12,637 --> 01:27:19,060
Over the rainbow I'm crazy.

532
01:27:19,102 --> 01:27:22,481
Bars in the window.

533
01:27:25,316 --> 01:27:30,405
There must have been a door there
in the wall.

534
01:27:30,488 --> 01:27:35,368
- When I came in.
- Crazy.

535
01:27:35,452 --> 01:27:41,541
Over the rainbow He is crazy.

536
01:27:45,463 --> 01:27:51,634
The evidence before the court
is incontrovertible.

537
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:55,805
There's no need
for the jury to retire.

538
01:27:58,057 --> 01:28:00,685
In all my years of judging

539
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,979
I have never heard before.

540
01:28:04,062 --> 01:28:06,649
Of someone more deserving.

541
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:10,695
The full penalty of law.

542
01:28:10,777 --> 01:28:13,198
The way you made them suffer.

543
01:28:13,281 --> 01:28:16,992
Your exquisite wife and mother.

544
01:28:17,034 --> 01:28:20,453
Fills me with the urge to defecate.

545
01:28:23,248 --> 01:28:28,962
Since, my friend
you have revealed your deepest fear

546
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:32,840
I sentence you to be exposed.

547
01:28:32,882 --> 01:28:35,928
Before your peers.

548
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:44,010
Tear down the wall.

549
01:31:45,029 --> 01:31:47,532
All alone.

550
01:31:47,573 --> 01:31:49,533
Or in two's.

551
01:31:51,286 --> 01:31:55,330
The ones who really love you.

552
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:02,254
Walk up and down.

553
01:32:02,338 --> 01:32:04,256
Outside the wall.

554
01:32:10,052 --> 01:32:14,016
Some hand in hand.

555
01:32:15,934 --> 01:32:20,230
Some gathered together in bands.

556
01:32:22,774 --> 01:32:28,071
The bleeding hearts
and the artists.

557
01:32:28,113 --> 01:32:30,072
Make their stand.

558
01:32:33,868 --> 01:32:39,248
And when they've given you their all.

559
01:32:39,332 --> 01:32:42,169
Some stagger and fall.

560
01:32:42,252 --> 01:32:45,671
After all, it's not easy.

561
01:32:47,924 --> 01:32:50,426
Banging your heart.

562
01:32:50,509 --> 01:32:55,055
Against some mad bugger's wall.

563
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:18,470
When they've given you their all.

564
01:34:18,512 --> 01:34:21,140
Some stagger and fall.

565
01:34:21,223 --> 01:34:24,601
After all, it's not easy
